PIETRO -- Reddit Game Jam 06 (Energy)
=====================================

Pietro Is Eager To Run Off is a physics-based locomotion game in the
spirit of [QWOP] [1].  You must help Pietro reach the other end of the
level by controlling his legs and using the least amount of energy in
the process.

You need to install haXe (readily packaged in several Linux distros)
in order to compile the game into a runnable SWF.  The physics code is
[Box2Dhx] [2], the haXe port of the AS3 version of Box2D.

The game is also [playable online] [3].

Controls:
---------

 * S - bend knees
 * F - straighten legs
 * Esc - retry current level with a clean slate
